# GitHub Repo Template

GitHub Repo Template is a template for creation of open source projects made
available on GitHub. It includes a permissive open source license, a developer
certificate of origin, and a pull request template. This provides everything
necessary to have a properly licensed open source project.

## Using GitHub Repo Template

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Copy its contents into your project (including the hidden .github directory). 
3. Customize each file to suit your project's needs (including the README). Look through the files for "TODO" and \<reponame\>, and replace with content appropriate to your project.
4. (Optional) Check out [GitHub Template Guidelines](https://github.com/cezaraugusto/github-template-guidelines) for ideas about how to customize your project.

## Git History & Rebasing Policy
Branch rebasing and other history modifications will be lister here, with several notable exceptions:
- Branches prefixed with `dev/` may be rebased, overwritten, or deleted at any time.
- Pull requests may be squashed on merge.

TODO: describe a project in detail, what it does, how to use it, etc.
